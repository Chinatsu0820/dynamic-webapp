# This is a Weather Dashboard app

This is not only one of the assignments but also my portfolio.

The requirements is below.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Dynamic Web App (Interactive)
This project should be a dynamic web application built with ES6+ JavaScript without use of any frameworks.

2. CSS Libraries: Bootstrap or Tailwind
The project should demonstrate understanding and appropriate usage of CSS Libraries(in this case, Bootstrap 5 or Tailwind CSS ) for styling elements.

3. DOM manipulation with vanilla / native JavaScript
The project should demonstrate understanding and appropriate usage of pure JavaScript functions and methods for manipulating the DOM and its elements without use of any libraries, frameworks, or tools.

4. DOM manipulation with JavaScript Libraries: jQuery
The project should also demonstrate understanding and appropriate usage of JavaScript Libraries. You will achieve this by using the jQuery library to manipulate the DOM and its elements.

Note: add comments in my JavaScript code to indicate where I am using native JS to manipulate the DOM, and where I am using a JavaScript Library (jQuery). 

5. API calls with vanilla / native ES6+ JavaScript: Fetch API
The project should demonstrate understanding and appropriate usage of native ES6+ JavaScript to make API calls to a server. (the modern Fetch API feature of JavaScript)

6. API calls with JavaScript Libraries: jQuery AJAX
The project should also demonstrate understanding and appropriate usage of JavaScript Libraries to make API calls to a server. (jQuery AJAX)

Note: add comments in my JavaScript code to indicate where I am using native JS to make API calls, and where I am using a JavaScript Library (jQuery AJAX). 

7. State Management with vanilla / native JavaScript
The project should demonstrate understanding and appropriate usage of native ES6+ JavaScript to preserve and update the state of data after the webpage or application is closed and re-opened. (by using localStorage, sessionStorage, or other means (without using any libraries, frameworks, or tools).)

Note: I just need to prove that I can save the progress/state of a web application upon closing it. If I use localStorage, I sould be aware of the following: 
 <a> It has a 5MB limit
 <b> I can only store string data, so my arrays and objects need to be parsed
 <c> It is inappropriate to store sensitive data such as login credentials in localStorage because it is not secure
 <d> LocalStorage is inaccessible in incognito/private browsing modes.

8. Responsive
The web app should be fully responsive, adapting well to the four categories of screen sizes: Phone, Tablet, Desktop, and Wide Screen.
